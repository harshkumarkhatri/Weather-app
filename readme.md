# Weather App
This is a weather app which i created in kotlin. This was my submission after the 30 days of kotlin challenge.
<br>**About the App**:-<br>
This is a simple app with a single screen. When you open the app you will be seeing a screen which will have the weather related to a place which is mentioned in the code. This is because we have the API which is passed with the location and we get back the weather details for that location. The layouting of the screen is simple yet elegant and has a gradient background.
